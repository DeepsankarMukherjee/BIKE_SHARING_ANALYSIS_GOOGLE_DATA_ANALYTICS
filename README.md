# ðŸš´ Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Project

# Business Scenario

Cyclistic, a bike-share program in Chicago, offers over 5,800 bicycles, including traditional bikes and assistive options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The program is popular for both leisure and commuting, with around 30% of users commuting to work. Cyclistic offers three pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members subscribe to yearly memberships.

The director of marketing believes that increasing the number of annual memberships is crucial for the companyâ€™s future success. To develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members, it's essential to understand how these two groups use Cyclistic bikes differently.

# Business Task

The task involves analyzing data from the previous 12 months (April 1, 2020, to March 30, 2021) to identify differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Based on these insights, the goal is to design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The analysis and recommendations must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations for presentation to the Cyclistic executive team.

# ASK

Primary Question:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# Key Stakeholders:

Lily Moreno, Director of Marketing
Cyclistic Executive Team

# PREPARE

Data Collection:

I gathered 12 months of data, each month represented by a separate CSV file, covering the period from April 1, 2020, to March 30, 2021.

Data Structure:

The data was well-organized and reliable, sourced from a real bike-sharing company in Chicago. It was comprehensive enough to analyze, although it lacked personally identifiable information (PII) and financial details, which posed some limitations on the depth of certain analyses.

Data Integrity:

The dataset was accurate, consistent, and trustworthy, ensuring a solid foundation for my analysis. However, it lacked data on assistive bike usage and financial transactions, which I had to account for in my recommendations.

# PROCESS

Data Cleaning:

I meticulously handled missing values, ensured consistency across all datasets, and standardized column names and data types to facilitate seamless analysis.

# Data Transformation:

To capture user behavior patterns, I created new features, such as ride duration, day of the week, and time of day.

# ANALYZE
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I compared the average ride duration between casual riders and annual members, analyzed the distribution of rides by day of the week and time of day, and identified the most popular stations and routes for each group. Additionally, I evaluated usage patterns, such as peak times and seasonal trends.

Statistical Analysis:

To ensure the reliability of my findings, I conducted hypothesis testing to determine if there were significant differences in ride behavior between casual riders and annual members.

# SHARE

Data Visualization:

I created clear, compelling visualizationsâ€”bar charts, line graphs, heatmapsâ€”to highlight the key differences in usage patterns between the two groups.

Reporting:

My detailed report included key insights, data visualizations, and a narrative that tied these insights directly to actionable marketing strategies.

Presentation:

I prepared a concise and impactful presentation for the Cyclistic executive team, emphasizing actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.

# ACT

Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: I proposed campaigns tailored to casual riders, emphasizing the cost savings and convenience of annual memberships.

Incentive Programs: To boost conversions, I recommended offering discounts or perks for casual riders who switch to annual memberships.

User Experience Enhancements: I suggested improvements to the booking process and app experience to encourage casual riders to commit to an annual plan.

Leisure vs. Commuting Segmentation: I advised segmenting marketing efforts based on whether riders use the service for leisure or commuting, with distinct messaging for each group.

# Limitations & Considerations:

Data Privacy: The absence of PII limited our ability to directly link rides to specific individuals, which restricted some aspects of behavior analysis.

Financial Data Absence: Without financial data, I couldnâ€™t perform a direct comparison of spending patterns, which would have further strengthened the case for conversion.

Assistive Bike Usage: The data lacked details on assistive bike usage, leaving a gap in insights for this subset of users.

# Expected Outcomes:

By understanding the differences between casual riders and annual members, Cyclistic can:

Increase Annual Memberships: Convert more casual riders into annual members, driving long-term revenue growth.

Enhance Customer Experience: Tailor services and marketing messages to better meet the needs of different user groups.

Optimize Operations: Improve resource allocation, such as bike distribution and station management, based on identified usage patterns.
